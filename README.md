# Contributing to the project

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution
process easy and effective for everyone involved.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of
the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return,
they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing
changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.


## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been
   reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the
   latest `master` or `next` branch in the repository.

3. **Isolate the problem** &mdash; ideally, create a reduced test case.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more
information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is
your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What OS experiences the
problem? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help
people to fix any potential bugs.

> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being
> reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as
> causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their
> merits).


## Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea
fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to *you* to make a strong
case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please
provide as much detail and context as possible.


## Pull requests

Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic
help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated
commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g.
implementing features, refactoring code), otherwise you risk spending a lot of
time working on something that the project's developers might not want to merge
into the project.

### For new Contributors

If you never created a pull request before, welcome: tada: : smile: [Here is a great tutorial](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)
on how to send one :)

1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone your fork,
   and configure the remotes:

   ```bash
   # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>
   # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
   cd <repo-name>
   # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/this projecthq/<repo-name>
   ```

2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

   ``` bash
   git checkout master
   git pull upstream master
   ```

3. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to
   contain your feature, change, or fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
   ```

4. Make sure to update, or add to the tests when appropriate. Patches and
   features will not be accepted without tests. Run `npm test` to check that all
 tests pass after you've made changes. Look for a `Testing` section in the
 project’s README for more information.

5. If you added or changed a feature, make sure to document it accordingly in
   the `README.md` file.

6. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin <topic-branch-name>
   ```

8. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
    with a clear title and description.

### For Members of the this project Contributors Team

1. Clone the repo and create a branch

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/this projecthq/<repo-name>
   cd <repo-name>
   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
   ```

2. Make sure to update, or add to the tests when appropriate. Patches and
   features will not be accepted without tests. Run `npm test` to check that all tests
 pass after you've made changes. Look for a `Testing` section in
   the project’s README for more information.

3. If you added or changed a feature, make sure to document it accordingly in
   the `README.md` file.

4. Push your topic branch up to our repo

   ```bash
   git push origin <topic-branch-name>
   ```

5. Open a Pull Request using your branch with a clear title and description.

Optionally, you can help us with these things. But don’t worry if they are too
complicated, we can help you out and teach you as we go :)

1. Update your branch to the latest changes in the upstream master branch. You
   can do that locally with

   ```bash
   git pull --rebase upstream master
   ```

   Afterward, force push your changes to your remote feature branch.

2. Once a pull request is good to go, you can tidy up your commit messages using
   Git's [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase).
   Please follow our commit message conventions shown below, as they are used by
   [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to automatically
 determine the new version and release to npm. In a nutshell:

# Issues
